## Search for locator widget width 730 (measured by screenshot), we get here

```C
// https://github.com/qtproject/qt-creator/blob/v4.1.0/src/plugins/coreplugin/locator/locatorwidget.cpp#L216
m_preferredSize = QSize(730, shint.height() * 17 + frameWidth() * 2);
```

## Load `libCore.so` into IDA

We cannot search for containing function `CompletionList::updatePreferredSize` so we find nearby functions then check their callers.

Search `itemDelegate` and find its callers, we get here

```txt
.text:00000000001D8059                 call    QAbstractItemView::itemDelegate(void)
...
.text:00000000001D80DA                 mov     dword ptr [rbp+30h], 2DAh
```

Now we can change `2DAh` (730) to something bigger but that not enough because in `CompletionList::CompletionList` the maximum widget width is limited to 900 by calling `setMaximumWidth(900);`

```c
// https://github.com/qtproject/qt-creator/blob/v4.1.0/src/plugins/coreplugin/locator/locatorwidget.cpp#L197
setMaximumWidth(900);
```

Its assembly is right above `CompletionList::updatePreferredSize` as in C++ code.

```txt
.text:00000000001D7FC8                 mov     esi, 384h
.text:00000000001D7FCD                 mov     rdi, rbx
.text:00000000001D7FD0                 call    QWidget::setMaximumWidth(int)
```

After patching this, the widget becomes bigger as we want it.
